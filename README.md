#CivsExtras

**CivsExtras** is an addon to the town-building plugin [**Civs**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/civs.67350/).

Like Civs, this is a work-in-progress. If you have any feature suggestion or bug report, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/JotaFaD/CivsExtras/issues). 

##Features

- **[BlueMap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bluemap.83557/) support** - Shows markers for regions on BlueMap.
- **Town Bar** - Shows a bar with the current power of a town when inside it. The bar also flashes when a region pays the players, generates/drains power or upkeeps.
- **F-Key binding**   - Let players open Civs' menu (or any command really) by pressing F with an empty hand.
- **Sound effect** - Play a sound when a region upkeeps.
